# Review-fix tracker — external review of `ffb35e6`

Working through the 32 findings of the 2026-09-15 external implementation
review (issue #6). Method: **failing regression first**, then the fix, then
green, one coherent commit per finding (or per tightly-coupled cluster).
A finding whose probe does not reproduce is investigated and marked
*disputed* with the evidence, never silently "fixed".

Corrected plan-item tally at review time: **19 present / 22 partial /
12 open** (of B1–B53). Optimizations O1–O9: mostly absent; handled as a
separate pass after correctness.

Bridge/SITL findings carry two verification states: *mock-verified*
(WebSocket mock, no autopilot) and *SITL-verified* (real ArduPilot flight).
A finding is not closed as SITL-verified until actually flown.

| # | Finding (short) | Review evidence | Regression test | Fix commit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Building collision at dt=0.05 | **reproduced**: entry t=0.35 s, x=85.399 (reviewer: x=85.394) | test/collision.test.js (4: head-on, corner clip, expel, overfly) | swept segment/AABB clamp + 2.5 m clearance in stepDrone | **fixed** |
| 2 | Upwind feasibility uses scalar wind | **reproduced** both ways: impossible return accepted AND easy downwind rejected | test/windvector.test.js (4) | groundSpeedAlong (wind vector, matches movement envelope) in orderFeasible + onboard RTH; unflyable leg = explicit reject | **fixed** |
| 3 | Unicast outcome decided at schedule time | **reproduced**: dead sender + moved receiver both delivered | test/netsched.test.js (2) | commit-at-transmission: liveness/RF/retries evaluated when air leaves the antenna | **fixed** |
| 4 | Forwarded broadcasts bypass channel/duty | **reproduced**: two copies overlapped at [1.02, 2.02] | test/netsched.test.js (1) | all transmissions through one earliest-eligible commit phase (control wins ties) | **fixed** |
| 5 | Expired traffic keeps channel reserved | **reproduced**: fresh cmd starved behind ghost queue; t=0 packet never aged | test/netsched.test.js (2) | no advance reservations to leak; TTL `??` fix; broadcast supersession + backlog cap | **fixed** |
| 6 | Objective connectivity not wired to consumers | **reproduced**: connected=true at launch w/ objective 1000 km away; 5 km short counted on long-range radio | test/objective.test.js (4) | `connected` = live route to a drone on-station (orbit-ring radius, radio-independent); `fleetConnected` split out; pill shows "en route"; 4 tests re-scoped to their true subject | **fixed** |
| 7 | Imported radio presets inject HTML | **reproduced**: live `<img>` in specCard; built-in SiK rewritten to 59 dBm; garbage fields registered | test/presetinject.test.js (4) | whitelist+bounds sanitizer (reject lying numbers), built-in ids collide to `-imported`, all preset strings escaped at render | **fixed** |
| 8 | Stale OSM `.then` overwrites new scenario | **reproduced**: B's target reverted 888→111 on A's late fetch; button stuck | test/osmrace.test.js (4) | generation carried through completion (`applied` result + gen check), button ownership cleanup, geocode + relaunch + terrain-change all cancel | **fixed** |
| 9 | External telemetry never goes stale | **reproduced**: 30 s-old sample still "current" | test/external.test.js (1) | local receipt-age staleness (3 s) feeds the freeze→dead ladder; stale policy documented | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| 10 | Old socket callbacks break reconnection | **reproduced**: ghost onclose un-readied live bridge | test/external.test.js (1) | every handler guarded by socket identity | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| 11 | External avoidance/landing unconfirmed | **reproduced**: landed+swap at 50 m; raw goal shipped through a 300 m tower | test/extgoals.test.js (3) | goals clipped short of no-fly footprints before shipping; RTB-over-pad commands descent; landing requires telemetry-confirmed touchdown (≤2 m) | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| 12 | Bridge readiness lacks ack/arm/takeoff check | **reproduced** in mock: success narrated after exception; ready listed all ids | sitl/test_bridge.py (3 of 6) | confirmed state machine: GUIDED via heartbeat, arm via ACK+armed flag, takeoff via ACK+climb; per-vehicle {ready, state} in the ready reply | **fixed (mock-verified — NOT flown; SITL open, VM offline)** |
| 13 | Late vehicle start / controller races | **reproduced** in mock: late heartbeat never initialized; second client stomped fleet | sitl/test_bridge.py (3 of 6) | one task per vehicle (sole socket reader) with resume-from-earliest-step recovery; telemetry never gated on the gather; controller ownership + init lock | **fixed (mock-verified — NOT flown; SITL open, VM offline)** |
| 14 | Batch workers unbounded/uncancellable | **reproduced**: 3 simultaneous requests → 3 workers, 200/200/200; no timeout | test/batchvalid.test.js (3) | bounded pool (2 workers, queue 8→429), per-run time budget (504+terminate), client-disconnect reaps the worker, exit-without-result handled | **fixed** |
| 15 | Video loss counts fragments as frames | **reproduced**: 4-frag chunk → 4 drops (+ expiry double) | test/vidframes.test.js (4) | one lifecycle per frame: tombstone on first loss, stragglers discarded, expiry merges | **fixed** |
| 16 | Utilization double-bills airtime | **reproduced**: 1 s of air read as 0.4 of a 5 s window | test/netsched.test.js (1) | billed once at actual transmission, per channel; busiest-channel share reported | **fixed** |
| 17 | ACK-replayed coverage samples double-count | **reproduced**: weight 3→6 on replay; 32 B bill for 3 riding samples | test/covdedup.test.js (4) | per-vehicle seq dedup at C2 (restart-aware), duplicates still ACKed, sample rows billed on air | **fixed** |
| 18 | Disconnected nav reads live truth | **reproduced**: denied black-box logged truth (97,98) w/ belief (1000,1000); rtb followed a silently-moved base | test/navbelief.test.js (3) | black box logs the BELIEF; base knowledge = launch briefing + C2 position riding every packet; rtb/rtl/relink/RTH plan on last-KNOWN base. Neighbor positions in the tether stay beacon-measurement-based (documented scope) | **fixed** |
| 19 | Failed A* still assigns blocked routes | **reproduced**: 12 slots through a solid wall, relays ordered onto them | test/planfail.test.js (3) | no-route → empty slot list + explicit C2 error, straight-line fallbacks guarded | **fixed** |
| 20 | Adversary band filtering wrong representation | **reproduced**: in-band hunter moved 0.0 m; silent target tracked live | test/advband.test.js (3) | jammerFreqMHz normalizer everywhere; DF fixes measured once at emission, kept as taken; txAt=actual emission via scheduler rework | **fixed** |
| 21 | Video grants lack expiry | **reproduced**: 13 chunks streamed past expiry on heartbeats alone | test/vidgrant.test.js (3) | orders carry absolute videoUntil + grant id; onboard check uses the deadline, never link freshness | **fixed** |
| 22 | OSM reload loses saved geometry/seed | **reproduced**: seed 7→45, drones spawned at origin | test/rebuild.test.js (1) | post-fetch rebuild carries the scenario's seed+base+target — built once, correctly | **fixed** |
| 23 | Calibrated presets not exported in scenario | **reproduced**: fresh page fell back to default radio | test/presetexport.test.js (2) | custom/calibrated definitions embedded in exports (built-ins stay id-only), validated on import | **fixed** |
| 24 | Count slider double-inits bridge | **reproduced**: 2 init messages per change | test/external.test.js (1) | handler's duplicate call removed; resetSwarm's central sync is the one path | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| 25 | External altitude datum undefined | **reproduced**: 120 m origin-relative read as 120 m AGL over hills | test/external.test.js (1) | contract defined: bridge alt = origin-relative (-NED.z); converted to AGL at the vehicle via ground-height delta | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| 26 | TAK export labels AGL as HAE | **reproduced**: hae=50.0 for 120 m AGL @ 500 m origin | test/takhae.test.js (3) | anchor carries a real vertical datum (origin HAE, UI field); exports = HAE + terrain + AGL; unknown origin omits hae | **fixed** |
| 27 | CoT regex truncates opposite quotes | **reproduced**: O'Brien → "O" | test/cotquotes.test.js (3) | backreference-matched quote delimiters in all attribute parsing; entity round-trips covered | **fixed** |
| 28 | Browser dt=0.05 vs batch dt=0.25 | **reproduced**: three step policies across browser/batch/bench | test/simdt.test.js (2) | SIM_DT_SEC defined once in swarm.js, consumed by browser+batch+bench; baseline regenerated at the true step (honest costs + fleet-uptime column) | **fixed** |
| 29 | Battery swaps counted twice | **reproduced**: full land→swap→relaunch cycle counted 2 | test/swapcount.test.js (1) | counted at the completed relaunch transition, log-text sniffing removed | **fixed** |
| 30 | Batch validation permissive on types | **reproduced**: count=1.5, seeds='bad', env='toString', null coords all accepted | test/batchvalid.test.js (2) | strict provided-field validation (wrong type ≠ omitted), integer counts, bounded nested cell fields & geometry, drone-second work budget | **fixed** |
| 31 | Failed tiles never retry | **reproduced**: hole persisted after network recovery | test/tileretry.test.js (2) | bounded exponential backoff (5 s→5 min), successes cached as before | **fixed** |
| 32 | City sliders bypass geometry/zero handling | **reproduced**: seed 0→42, city centred off the moved corridor | test/rebuild.test.js (1) | regeneration uses base→target geometry and null-safe seed | **fixed** |

Optimizations O1–O9: tracked after the 32 correctness findings; each will be
implemented against a measured benchmark, not marked done by adjacency.

## Optimization pass (O1-O9)

| Opt | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| O1 drone id map | **done** | nodePos Map (self-healing) replaces per-hop linear find |
| O2 per-step RF/LOS caches | **substantially covered** | per-tick margin cache (pre-existing) + O9 ray-walk LOS; further caching deferred until a profile demands it |
| O3 browser sim worker | **deferred, deliberately** | swarm state is shared live with the renderer and mutated by UI drags; a worker port means snapshot serialization every frame — measured budget (sub-realtime only >=140 drones at 20 Hz) does not justify the redesign yet |
| O4 A* binary heap | **done** | open list linear-scan+splice -> min-heap, lazy stale-skip kept |
| O5 cached mission membership | **done** | one flock snapshot per tick (was per-drone O(N^2)) |
| O6 3D static-scene cache | **done** | ground+building projections reused while camera/terrain/canvas hold; textures stream by reference |
| O7 incremental DOM rows | **done** | fleet list uses keyed incremental rows; hops/event panels skip identical HTML |
| O8 city-slider debounce | **done** | slider debounce + 2D viewport culling of off-screen buildings (drawTerrain) |
| O9 ring/pruning family | **done** | capture batch-trim, coverage-map bound (oldest-first), sep-grid history purge, LOS candidates by ray-walk (was full-list for long links) |

## Follow-up review of `04ca373` (2026-09-17)

Findings F01–F14 from the second external review. Verification status:
mock-verified via the existing browser/DOM harnesses, the Python MAVLink
stubs (sitl/test_bridge.py), and the standalone executable mock (sitl/test_mock_vehicles.py);
real SITL flight acceptance is still open (see "Remaining").

| ID | Finding (short) | Regression | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F01 | Browser declared failed vehicles ready; goals shipped during failed init | test/external.test.js (per-vehicle ready/state incl. late recovery), test/extgoals.test.js, sitl/test_bridge.py (goal gates) | per-vehicle readiness carried through ready+telemetry, rendered honestly; goals require bridge-side ready state AND browser-side readiness evidence | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| F02 | Unowned fleet controllable by every watcher | sitl/test_bridge.py (two watchers after disconnect, takeover, await-races) | goals require an acquired, connected controller; init is the only acquisition; ownership rechecked after awaits | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| F03 | Fresh heartbeat concealed stale position | sitl/test_bridge.py (receipt clock, stale climb), test/external.test.js (stalled seq, never-received) | positionAge/positionSeq tracked per vehicle; freshness judged per position sample, independent of heartbeat/JSON traffic | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| F04 | Low altitude started a swap without confirmed landing; no relaunch handshake | test/extgoals.test.js (stale-landed refusal, retry, RTL landing), sitl/test_bridge.py (handshake, fraud refusal, descent progress, late recovery, datum conversion, abort-hold, resume, ACKs), sitl/test_mock_vehicles.py (executable mock cycles, elevated/sunken landing, 90s swap freshness) | explicit land → landed(EXTENDED_SYS_STATE) → authorize → complete → relaunch → ready handshake; descent progress tracking (≥0.5m) and late touchdown recovery; grounded requires fresh landed+disarmed evidence throughout 90s swap; relaunch datum conversion (AGL climb relative to ground alt); airborne abort-to-hold in GUIDED with explicit resume and goal suppression; machine-readable ACKs and idempotent duplicate handling | **fixed (mock-verified — NOT flown; SITL open, VM offline)** |
| F05 | Altitude reference moved with the operator; AGL goals unconverted | sitl/test_bridge.py (origin round-trip, nonzero XY + ground offset), test/external.test.js | immutable common-local origin frozen at connect, sent in init; incoming positions and outgoing goals both converted against it | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| F06 | Goal could cross a building beyond the 600 m scan horizon | test/obstacles.test.js (tower at 1000 m, goal at 2000 m) | commanded leg capped to the verified scan horizon, not the raw goal | **fixed** |
| F07 | Expired packet committed before the TTL check | test/netsched.test.js (t=11.05 boundary) | expiry checked before selection and emission; no channel-clock advance for expired work | **fixed** |
| F08 | Unicast delivered after transmitter died mid-airtime | test/netsched.test.js (before/mid/after airtime deaths, immediate interruption capture surviving revival) | explicit attempt lifecycle; unfinished frames invalidated on endpoint death; immediate interruptedAt capture on active attempts when death/removal occurs; airtime truncated at interruption; RF sampled per attempt; completed transmission preserved if receiver was alive at arrival | **fixed** |
| F09 | Utilization billed the whole transmission to its starting window | test/netsched.test.js (0.02/0.18 window split) | on-air intervals intersected with reporting windows; retry gaps excluded; per-channel | **fixed** |
| F10 | Out-of-order coverage upload counted as restart | test/covdedup.test.js (reorder vs new session) | dedup by (vehicle, session, sequence) with stable session ids; session in ACKs | **fixed** |
| F11 | Tether steering read upstream live truth | test/navbelief.test.js (silent neighbor move) | upstream positions enter the tether only via timestamped modeled observations; documented stale fallback | **fixed** |
| F12 | Legacy band aliases parsed as MHz numbers | test/advband.test.js ('2.4g'/'5g' equivalence) | aliases resolved before numeric parsing; strict numeric strings; malformed prefixes rejected | **fixed** |
| F13 | Nested batch features unchecked | test/batchvalid.test.js (65 malformed cases) | nested features validated pre-normalization (booleans, bounded numerics, array shapes); CLI and API reject identically | **fixed** |
| F14 | 3D cache ignored base/target geometry | test/view3d.test.js (22 mutation regressions) | cache key covers camera, mesh bounds, terrain/texture geometry and anchor coordinates | **fixed** |

### Remaining

- **SITL acceptance run (real flight):** still required — initialization,
  late joins, telemetry loss, owner handoff, obstacle-limited goals, landing
  and relaunch on real ArduPilot SITL. Everything above is mock-verified across
  both Python MAVLink stub harness (sitl/test_bridge.py) and standalone
  executable mock (sitl/test_mock_vehicles.py); real SITL verification stays separate.
- **O-ledger corrections:** O2 cache boundaries/hit-rate unmeasured;
  O3 deferred (decide on browser frame latency, not headless ticks);
  O7 = skip-identical-HTML and keyed row updates implemented;
  O8 = debounce and 2D viewport building culling implemented;
  preserved raw samples recorded in bench/results.json and bench/BASELINE.md.

## Third external review fixes (W01–W10) — 2026-09-19

Findings W01–W10 from the third external verification review:

| ID | Finding (short) | Review evidence | Regression test | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W01 | Temporary rejections cached permanently | Rejections cached in `service_action_history`, preventing recovery when vehicle became ready | `sitl/test_bridge.py` (retryable rejection recovery test), `sitl/test_mock_vehicles.py` (test_service_acks_and_idempotency) | Only cache in `service_action_history` if `accepted is True`; retryable rejections re-evaluate on subsequent requests | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| W02 | Incomplete browser retry policy | Retries bypassed 0.5s throttle interval, telemetry revived `failed` phase, missing ACKs stalled indefinitely | `test/extgoals.test.js` (throttle delay, telemetry cannot revive failed phase, missing ACK retry exhaustion) | Helper `dispatchServiceAction` enforces 0.5s throttle across attempts; routine telemetry guarded with `phase !== 'failed'`; 5 missing ACKs transitions to terminal `failed` | **fixed** |
| W03 | Slow mock landings timeout healthy descent | 10-second timeout triggered on healthy descent from high altitude; tests missed because clock was unadvanced | `sitl/test_mock_vehicles.py` (test_slow_healthy_descent_stalled_timeout_and_late_recovery, controllable Clock) | Track descent progress (≥0.5m resets timeout clock); touchdown detection and disarming active in `failed` phase to allow late recovery; controllable clock in tests | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| W04 | Abort below launch elevation misclassified as grounded | Origin-relative altitude (`alt > launch_alt + 0.5`) misclassified airborne vehicles at negative elevation as grounded | `sitl/test_bridge.py` (below origin -5m, low hover +0.1m, stale position abort tests), `sitl/test_mock_vehicles.py` (test_airborne_and_grounded_abort) | Ground-independent abort classification: `is_grounded = bool(grounded or ((landed, swapping, swapped) and not armed))`; airborne vehicles enter dedicated `INIT_ABORT_HOLD` in GUIDED mode | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| W05 | Airtime cut check overcounted on late network ticks | `s.time < a.end` evaluated network tick time rather than packet cut time `tCut`, skipping airtime truncation | `test/netsched.test.js` (late network tick after sender death at t=1.02 truncated to 1.02) | Base truncation on `tCut < a.end`; truncate `a.air.end` and `channel.airUntil` to `Math.max(a.start, tCut)` | **fixed** |
| W06 | C2 reconnection reverted landing/swap mode | C2 link restored commands reverted `d.mode` to `'ok'`, aborting landing/swap timers | `test/extgoals.test.js` (external RTL landing through C2 reconnection during descent) | In `droneComms`, check `!inExternalService` before reverting `d.mode` from `hold`/`relink`/`rtl` to `'ok'` | **fixed** |
| W07 | Abort commands stale position | Abort immediately sent position target without checking freshness; hold loop maintained stale target | `sitl/test_bridge.py` (scenario_c04 1d stale pos abort and fresh target capture/retention) | When position is stale, do not send setpoint; enter `INIT_CONFIRM_ABORT` until fresh sample qualifies, capture hold target from fresh sample, and retain it | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| W08 | Abort mode change unconfirmed | Abort sent single mode request with no retry or timeout; duplicate abort returned cached accepted | `sitl/test_bridge.py` (scenario_c04 1e timeout, 1f late confirmation) | In `INIT_CONFIRM_ABORT`, retry mode request every 2s, timeout after 10s to `failed:abort` with `service_phase='failed'`; hold setpoints blocked until GUIDED confirmed | **fixed (mock-verified)** |
| W09 | Telemetry recovery turns swapping to ok | `externalPullPositions` revived all `!alive(d)` drones to `ok`, overwriting grounded swapping drone | `test/extgoals.test.js` (W09 full RTL lifecycle with gap during swap) | In `externalPullPositions`, check `if (d.mode === 'dead')` before reviving; preserve `d.mode === 'landed'` during battery swap gaps | **fixed** |
| W10 | Abort confirmed from expired heartbeat | Abort entered abort-hold and commanded setpoints with >3.0s expired GUIDED heartbeat | `sitl/test_bridge.py` (scenario_c04 1g stale heartbeat abort gate), `sitl/test_mock_vehicles.py` (test_airborne_and_grounded_abort 2d) | Require `connected and mode_confirmed and position_fresh` for abort confirmation and hold setpoint emission; retry mode requests when disconnected; mirror in mock | **fixed (mock-verified)** |

Suite status: **333/333 JavaScript tests pass**, **19/19 bridge scenarios pass**, **8/8 executable mock scenarios pass**. Real SITL flight acceptance remains an offline/separate step.

## Real ArduPilot SITL acceptance + two audits — 2026-09-28

### Real SITL acceptance (ArduCopter 4.7.1, 3 vehicles, WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04)

Run: `sitl/run_ardupilot_sitl.sh 3` (inside the ArduPilot checkout), then
`python sitl/run_acceptance.py --mode real --count 3`. Final run: **8/8 steps
passed** (report `sitl/acceptance_report.json`, git-ignored):

| Step | Measured on real ArduPilot |
|---|---|
| 2 takeoff to altitude | READY at 15.0 / 14.0 / 14.0 m of a 15 m takeoff (30.5 s from fresh boot, incl. EKF settle) |
| 3 waypoints | flew 104 / 202 / 301 m; ended 0.0 / 0.1 / 7.8 m from goal |
| 4 freshness | position age 0.05–0.07 s, sequence advancing |
| 5 abort-to-hold | confirmed `abort-hold` state, resumed to READY at 15.0 m |
| 6 landing | 15.0 m to confirmed touchdown in 27.0 s |
| 7–8 swap + relaunch | swap handshake acked; relaunch climbed to 19.0 m (pad −0.01 m + 20 m climb) |

Findings from the real runs (each reproduced first, then fixed):

| Issue | Finding | Evidence | Regression | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #7 | Runner started bridge with `--port` | argparse exit 2 | test_bridge "#7" | 0de5d6e | fixed |
| #9 | Launcher: parallel per-instance rebuilds killed instances; shared eeprom.bin; re-configure took minutes under load | instance 1 died (`waf configure` exit 512) while "All 3 launched" printed; 12+ min configure at 100 % CPU | real launches (no ArduPilot in CI) | 45ac861, e0b0948 | fixed (SITL-exercised: 3/3 up in 16–42 s) |
| #10 | Runner rejected advisory `status` before `ready`; mock sent them in the opposite order | real step 1 failed on the bridge's first status | mock now status-first; mock acceptance in CI | 780712e | fixed |
| #11 | Runner gave the server 8.5 s and piped output it never read | bridge took 8.4 s to listen from a slow mount | test_bridge "#11" ×2 | 780712e | fixed |
| #12 | **Bridge declared READY at 1 m**, not at the takeoff altitude (PROTOCOL.md: climb ≥ alt − 1 m) | real: READY at 1.0 m of 15 m; relaunch READY at 1.1 m | test_bridge "#12" ×4, conformance | 780712e, cc12d49 | fixed (SITL-exercised: READY at 14–15 m) |
| — | Runner assertions were flag-only (takeoff 0.03 s "pass", no waypoint flight check, 25 s landing deadline) | real passes proved nothing; a true 15 m landing needs ~27 s | runner steps 2–8 verify altitude, flight to goals, freshness, confirmed hold, descent progress, relaunch climb | 780712e, e0b0948 | fixed |

**Verification status of earlier bridge/external findings.** Exercised on real
ArduPilot by the acceptance run: #12 readiness (ACK/arm/takeoff + altitude),
F04 land→landed→swap→relaunch handshake, F05/#25 bridge-side altitude datum,
W04/W07/W08/W10 abort-to-hold, the bridge side of #11 (landed only after real
touchdown). **Still mock-only** (not exercised by any real run): #9 browser
staleness, #10 socket identity/reconnect, #13 late vehicle joins and
controller races, #24 count-slider re-init, F02 owner handoff, browser-side
obstacle clipping, injected telemetry loss.

### Relay-chain stability audit — fixes

Scenario matrix: 23 scenarios × 1–5 seeds, 900–1800 s each.

| Issue | Finding | Before → after | Regression | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #8 | Map drew one route to a random orbiting drone; routing tree flapped | endpoint not nearest 88 % of the time; 252 parent changes / 3 min (127 straight back) → all real links drawn, 0 flicker | drawnchain ×2, routeflap ×3 | fd32a0c, 4ac1b8b |
| #13 | Drones froze against walls/corners at full speed | slid 0 m; DR-3/4/7 still for 60 s at 10–14 m/s → slides 85+ m; repro drone flies 338 m | wallslide ×2 | 8226a4a |
| #14 | Order flood saturated the channel at scale | 30 drones SiK: busy 100→65 %, C2 contact 27→100 %, reshuffles 24→0. 120 drones: busy 100→69 %, contact ≤20→100 %, reshuffles ~200→0, objective reached | floodscale ×4 | e2e2377 |
| #15 | LOS densify stacked slots within metres | 12 slots, closest 0 m apart → 4–5 slots | densify ×2 | 6f50baa |
| #16 | Slow healing after a relay kill | dead upstream still read 19 dB; stale rescue pulled a mission drone → tether closes, search called off | healing ×4 | fd33926 |
| #17 | covAdjust jumped whole cells | slot moved 3318 m to clear a 420 m zone → 440 m | covadjust ×2 | ece0466 |
| #18 | Tether lurch; rescuer upstream rotation | 100 m goal jump across 0.002 dB → continuous; 36 upstream changes / 20 rounds → ≤1 | tetherramp ×2, rescuesticky | 3c670fb |
| #19 | Link colour / dB label flicker | 86 colour flips, 453 label changes / 120 s → 8 / 61 | linkview ×2 | b1b387d |
| #27 | Planner froze the sim; GPS zones treated as radio walls | jammer on target 17 s per plan (every 5 s) → 8.5 ms, reused until the world changes; 100 km 16.9 s → 45 ms; GPS zone on base: no plan → plan | planperf ×4 | 6943d8b |

Open (tracked, not fixed): #28 planner ignores interference on hop margins
(DDIL Full 0 % uptime); #29 infeasible plans draft every mission drone;
#30 rescue call-off ignores C2's own coverage.

### Soak / fuzz / invariant audit — fixes

Coverage: 90 schema-valid fuzz configs (48.4 sim-hours, 592 drone-hours),
15 mid-run perturbation configs, 3–4 h soaks, 1,200 UI fuzz actions, 6,000
bridge-fuzz steps, 30 malformed server requests. Held throughout: no
exceptions, finite state, speed envelope, no building incursion, battery only
rises on swaps, bounded structures, **determinism 21/21**, flat heap after GC.

| Issue | Finding | Regression | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| #20 | Replay button always failed in the page; capture header missing jammers/zones/terrain | replaycapture ×4 | 8330b5a |
| #21 | One frame exception killed the render loop | frameloop | 94d4c41 |
| #22 | External mode revived killed drones; bridge input not shape-checked | extrobust ×5 | 4bc0d50 |
| #23 | Target on base over hills → NaN terrain; NaN margins delivered broadcasts | nanterrain ×3 | 80e9a4a |
| #24 | Batch/server contract gaps (100 Mbps video, unknown fields, 413, CLI) | batchcontract ×5 | 77caf80, 66fd8e2 |
| #25 | Scenario loader accepted untyped fields, half-applied bad files | scenarioload ×14 | b1c7e22 |
| #26 | Coverage trim evicted newest cell; denial band; dedup growth; wind swap churn | hygiene ×4 | 69f38b8 |

Deferred with reason: the O(P²) video-fragment commit loop (net.js commit
path) — the 2000 kbps cap removes the API trigger (~489 packets per chunk at
the UI maximum).

Suite status: **404/404 JavaScript tests**, **26/26 bridge scenarios**,
**8/8 executable-mock scenarios**, protocol conformance, **4/4 failure
scenarios**, mock acceptance 8/8 (in CI); **real SITL acceptance 8/8**
(manual, ArduCopter 4.7.1).
